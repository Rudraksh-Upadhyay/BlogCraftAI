## **Technologies Used**

* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python framework for web apps)  
* **Backend/AI:** Google Gemini API (google-generativeai Python library)  
* **Environment Management:** python-dotenv  
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.9+ installed on your system.  
* pip (Python package installer).  
* A Google Gemini API Key (obtainable for free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)).

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR\_USERNAME/AI-Blog-Companion.git  
   cd AI-Blog-Companion

   *(Replace YOUR\_USERNAME with your GitHub username and AI-Blog-Companion with your repository name if different).*  
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**  
   * **macOS/Linux:**  
     python \-m venv venv  
     source venv/bin/activate

   * **Windows (Command Prompt):**  
     python \-m venv venv  
     venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat

   * **Windows (PowerShell):**  
     python \-m venv venv  
     .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

3. **Install the required Python packages:**  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

4. **Set up your Google Gemini API Key:**  
   * Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory.  
   * Add your Gemini API key to this file in the following format:  
     GOOGLE\_API\_KEY='YOUR\_ACTUAL\_GEMINI\_API\_KEY'

     *(Replace YOUR\_ACTUAL\_GEMINI\_API\_KEY with the key you obtained from Google AI Studio).*

### **Running the Application Locally**

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

This will open the application in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:8501.

## **Usage**

1. **Enter Blog Details:** In the sidebar, fill in the Blog Title and Keywords (comma-separated).  
2. **Adjust Word Count:** Use the slider to set your desired number of words for the blog post.  
3. **Generate Blog Post:** Click the "Generate Blog Post" button.  
4. **View Results:** The generated blog post will appear in the main content area of the application.

## **Future Enhancements**

* **Image Generation Integration:** Implement a free image generation API (e.g., a Stable Diffusion variant with a free tier) to automatically generate images based on the blog title.  
* **Blog Post Editing:** Add functionality for users to edit the generated text directly within the application.  
* **Export Options:** Allow users to export the generated blog post to various formats (e.g., Markdown, PDF, HTML).  
* **Topic Suggestions:** Implement AI-powered topic suggestions based on user interests or trending topics.
